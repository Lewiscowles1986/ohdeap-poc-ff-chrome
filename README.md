## Motivation

I've been wanting to make a cross-browser extension for some time. This is the first extension with a single codebase which works across browsers. I Admittedly picked an API I've used in many other plugins, but the idea is that it has a few features I've wanted to use for a while.

Now this is in a nice condition I'd like to hand-off to https://github.com/ohdearapp/chrome-extension (as soon as please)
